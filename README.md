## 1. Overview
This repository contains the scripts and data structures for the MRN (Metacognitive Resilience Network) project. It focuses on integrating and analyzing data from neuroimaging studies, cognitive assessments, clinical outcomes, and participant demographics. The goal is to explore resilience metrics in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease.
Key features:
- Comprehensive data handling for large datasets
- Automated processing and integration of multi-modal data
- Statistical metrics for hippocampal and PFC resilience
- Identification of clinical risk categories
## 2. Data Structure
